\note{
Good afternoon everybody. My name's Mark Farrell and I've been doing research for CREA
remotely from Canada. Today I'd like to inform you about a method I've been working on for
automating the construction of biomedical knowledge bases; specifically a knowledge base on aging.
The presentation should be about 20 minutes in length and there will be an opportunity to ask
questions at the end.

\note{
That's all very well and good: I haven't explained how I got involved
with research at CREA. Steve Garan (you might know him) emailed the University of Waterloo
Computer Science Club back in January, looking for
current members interested in an AI internship; he used to
be President back in the 80s. It looked interesting, so I began working
with him, meeting weekly on Skype to discuss progress.

decades.

\end{tikzpicture}

\note{

And that's where I come in. I've been trying to work on a solution to this problem, which
involves building a knowledge base, software, that can assist humans in order to understand
aging and develop theories about it.

Have a look at this figure: the idea behind the software project I'm working on is to get a machine
to read text and try to understand aging, just like how human's can try understand to aging by
reading texts and journal articles. And also, to present a machine's understanding of aging to humans
and allow them correct and modify the machine's understanding of aging in an intuitive way.

\section{Knowledge Extraction}

\note{
To date, I've made quite a bit of progress in allowing a machine to read and extract knowledge from
text articles, and have also been able to display that knowledge in a manner that helps humans understand aging.
However, I haven't made much progress on allowing the machine to form a theory of aging and reason about aging
itself; i.e. it can't really decide what knowledge is relevant to aging and what it is not.

\note{
As Steve Garan put it, aging can be looked at as the degradation over
time and eventual failure of an organism's systems. So let's start off
talking about knowledge extraction with an excerpt from a journal abstract
that is related to elastin degradation. Have a look at the example input sentence:
I've highlighted the literal nouns found in the sentence and the literal verbs that
relate nouns to one another. Now look at the output: knowledge extraction is the process
of identifying literal nouns and relating them to each other, i.e. making logical assertions
about the actions that they can perform on one another.
